# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- A simple and functional weather app that can get current weather data and a 5-day forecast from a city.
- With this application, you can find the current weather in your city, or a city where you would be traveling to.
- Weather Data and Geolocation is provided by OpenWeatherMap's API.
- This weather app has greatly furthered my knowledge in RESTful APIs, and increased my proficiency in Bootstrap and JavaScript.

## Installation

## Usage


**When first visiting the website, you will be presented with the following image. By design, the website will default to San Diego for weather upon refresh/initialization**

**On the left of the website, there is a searchbar where you can input a city name. In this example, we will choose the city of Houston, Texas. When pressing the "search" button, you will be presented with the searched city's weather & forecast.**

**Upon refresh, you will be defaulted back to San Diego's weather. This is by design in the code, however, your recent city searches will show up under the "recent searches" text on the sidebar.**
